# grab-sg-jakarta-data-analytics
Project was embarked on for NUS Data Analytics Competition (2022) which  partnered with Grab. 
Analyse Grab's real dataset and finding respective insights from dataset of 2 different locations: Singapore and Jakarta

# Problem Statement 
There has been feedback about delays in Grab transport services in both Jakarta and Singapore (late driver arrival -> late arrival at destination). This has led to a decrease in customer satisfaction and trust, which might increase customer turnover. Upon further research, it was found that this could be due to inaccurate ETA prediction, bad route planning, or other factors. Using the above dataset of GPS pings, what insights can your team obtain to help Grab alleviate these issues?
